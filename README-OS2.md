SWT for OS/2
============

This project will implement SWT for OS/2-eCS.

The project takes the existing SWT-Win32 Platform Implementation and modifies
it so it can use Odin32, the OS/2 implementation of the Win32-API.

It depends on the following OS/2-eCS components:

* The OS/2-eCS OpenJDK6 component
* The OS/2-eCS Odin32 component
* The OS/2-eCS GCC tool-chain
* Ant for OS/2
* Anything not mentioned yet

Since this is a fork of the Eclipse SWT Git Repository, you are advised to
back-track to the parent for additional information about Eclipse SWT.
